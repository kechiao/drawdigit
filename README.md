# drawdigit
Project testing various classifiers' accuracies on user drawn single digits

This is a quick project involving simple digit classification on the MNIST (http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) dataset. 

The objective of training on the dataset and classifying on the test set is as follows from the Kaggle.com competition (https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer/): "The goal in this competition is to take an image of a handwritten single digit, and determine what that digit is." 

# Approach
In typical machine learning problems, the most basic and standard pipeline is as follows:

1) Preprocessing the data

2) Training a classifier on the data

3) Testing the classifier's performance
